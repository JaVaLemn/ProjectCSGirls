# ProjectCSGirls
This is Katie and Kristen's ProjectCSGirls repository. This is where we will write all of our code for our 2022 ProjectCSGirls project! :)

Our project is the Enviro Alarm, Safer Air.
We used the RaspberryPi for this project as you will see in our code.

Thanks for looking at our repository!
